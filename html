    <p>A swimming pool-based triathlon can be a great place to start if you are not particularly confident in the water. Equally, they are a good option if you are looking to compete at the start or end of the season when open-water events would be too cold.

Pool-based swims are often 400m in distance, but can be shorter or longer, and the length of the pool will vary from event to event. Swimmers normally set off individually at timed intervals, but how the swim is navigated varies (for example, moving from lane to lane in a zig-zag style or completing the swim in one designated lane).

You may feel of course that the real challenge is in open-water swimming. Open-water swims can be held in a lake, river, or the sea. A lake swim is likely to be calmer than a river or sea swim, where you obviously have to contend with waves and the current.

Open-water swims normally have mass starts, broken up into waves (at larger events, it is not uncommon for a wave to include around 100 athletes).</p>

    <p>he vast majority of triathlons are non-drafting and held on open roads with traffic. However, closed circuits (racetracks) are becoming more popular.

Triathlons can also have off-road bike sections, which will normally require the use of a mountain bike (British Triathlon’s competition rules only permit mountain bikes for cross triathlon). Events with off-road bike sections are commonly referred to as ‘cross triathlon’.

XTERRA is the main international series of cross triathlon and, rather than road riding and running, has off-road mountain biking and trail running.</p>

    <p>Similar to the bike options, a run can be on the road, off-road, or commonly a bit of both. Your choice of footwear will depend on the terrain. Importantly, a 10k run on a flat road may be much less taxing than a 10k on an undulating and uneven off-road route.</p>

    <h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
    <p>There is a triathlon for everyone. Depending on your strengths and sporting background, along with your appetite for a challenge, particular race distances and conditions may appeal to you.

There are a number of race listing resources globally. In the UK, the British Triathlon website is a good starting point, which will feature all of the events registered with the national governing body. British Triathlon also supports GO TRI, a resource for people who are very new to the sport.

Another great way to get started in triathlon is to join a triathlon club. It’s worth checking to see if you have one locally. Much easier when things are close by.

Many triathlon clubs cater for beginners through to experienced triathletes. You’ll be surrounded by like-minded people who are willing to share their experiences and advice.

In particular, taking part in coached swim sessions can be very beneficial for beginners; and, bike and run sessions with other people can really push you forward.</p>
